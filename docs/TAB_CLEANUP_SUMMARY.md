## 🔧 What Changed

### Before:
- 11 .tsx files in tabs folder
- Duplicate versions (original + refactored)
- Unused tabs (cooking-history, swipe-optimized)
- Confusing file structure

### After:
- 6 .tsx files (5 tabs + layout)
- Clean, single version of each tab
- Refactored components in use
- Old files safely backed up

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Cleaner Navigation**: No duplicate tabs showing up
2. **Better Performance**: Using optimized refactored components
3. **Maintainability**: Clear which files are active
4. **Safety**: Original files preserved in backup folder

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the app to ensure navigation works properly
2. Verify all imports are resolved correctly
3. Consider removing backup folder after testing
4. Update any documentation referencing old file names
