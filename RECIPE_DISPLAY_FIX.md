# Recipe Display Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Description
**Problem**: No recipes appeared after logging in
**Symptoms**: User could "log in" but swipe screen showed no recipe cards
**Root Cause**: Authentication was not actually implemented, causing API calls to fail

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Authentication Not Implemented
- Sign-in/sign-up screens were just redirecting without actual authentication
- No session was being created with Better Auth
- No cookies were being set for API authorization

### 2. Protected API Endpoints
- Recipe endpoints use `protectedProcedure` requiring valid session
- Without authentication, API calls returned unauthorized errors
- User profile (DindinUser) was never created in database

### 3. Missing User Profile
- Recipe API requires DindinUser profile linked to auth user
- Profile is checked to track liked/disliked recipes
- Without profile, even authenticated users would get errors

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Implemented Real Authentication

**Sign In Screen** (`app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`):
```typescript
const result = await authClient.signIn.email({
  email,
  password,
});
```

**Sign Up Screen** (`app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx`):
```typescript
const result = await authClient.signUp.email({
  email,
  password,
  name,
});
```

### Step 2: Added Authentication Check

**Index Screen** (`app/index.tsx`):
```typescript
const checkAuthStatus = async () => {
  const session = await authClient.getSession();
  setIsAuthenticated(!!session?.data);
};
```

### Step 3: Configured Auth Client
- Better Auth client already configured with expo plugin
- Uses SecureStore for token storage
- Sends cookies with API requests

## How It Works Now

1. **User Signs Up/In**:
   - Creates auth user in Better Auth system
   - Session created and stored securely
   - Cookies set for API authorization

2. **API Calls Work**:
   - tRPC client includes auth cookies in headers
   - Protected procedures validate session
   - User profile auto-created on first recipe fetch

3. **Recipes Display**:
   - Recipe endpoint returns unseen recipes
   - Cards render with data from MongoDB
   - Swipe actions update user's liked/disliked lists

## Testing Instructions

### Create a New Account:
1. Open the app
2. Tap "Sign Up"
3. Enter:
   - Name: Any name
   - Email: Any valid email
   - Password: At least 6 characters
4. Tap "Create Account"
5. You'll be redirected to swipe screen with recipes!

### Or Sign In:
1. Use existing account credentials
2. Recipes will load from MongoDB

## Database Status
- ✅ MongoDB running: `dindin-app-mongodb` container
- ✅ 8 sample recipes loaded in database
- ✅ Backend server running on port 3000
- ✅ Authentication system configured

## Files Modified
1. `/apps/native/app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx` - Added real authentication
2. `/apps/native/app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx` - Added account creation
3. `/apps/native/app/index.tsx` - Added session checking

## Verification
- ✅ Authentication works
- ✅ Sessions persist
- ✅ API calls authorized
- ✅ Recipes load from MongoDB
- ✅ Swipe functionality works

## Status
**RESOLVED** - Users can now sign up, sign in, and see recipe cards populated from the MongoDB database. The swipe functionality works with full authentication and data persistence.
