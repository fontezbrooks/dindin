# User Profile Not Found Error - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Description
**Error**: "User profile not found" when fetching recipes
**Code**: NOT_FOUND (404)
**Location**: recipe.getRecipeStack endpoint
**Impact**: Authenticated users couldn't see recipes despite successful sign-in

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:
1. **Two separate user systems**: Better Auth creates auth users, but the app needs DindinUser profiles
2. **No auto-creation**: Recipe endpoint expected DindinUser profile to exist but didn't create it
3. **Missing link**: Sign-up/sign-in created auth user but not the DindinUser profile

### Data Model Structure
```
Better Auth User (auth system)     DindinUser (app profile)
├── id                             ├── authUserId (links to auth user)
├── email                          ├── name
├── name                           ├── email
└── password (hashed)              ├── likedRecipes[]
                                   ├── dislikedRecipes[]
                                   ├── preferences
                                   └── stats
```

## Solution Applied

### Modified Recipe Router
Changed from throwing error to auto-creating profile:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Threw error if profile not found
if (!user) {
  throw new TRPCError({
    code: "NOT_FOUND",
    message: "User profile not found",
  });
}

// AFTER: Auto-creates profile
if (!user) {
  user = await DindinUser.create({
    authUserId: ctx.session.user.id,
    name: ctx.session.user.name || 'User',
    email: ctx.session.user.email,
    likedRecipes: [],
    dislikedRecipes: [],
    // ... other default fields
  });
}
```

### Files Modified
1. `/apps/server/src/routers/recipe.ts`:
   - `getRecipeStack`: Now auto-creates profile
   - `likeRecipe`: Now auto-creates profile

2. `/apps/server/src/routers/user.ts`:
   - `getProfile`: Already had auto-creation (unchanged)

## How It Works Now

1. **User signs up/signs in**:
   - Better Auth creates/validates auth user
   - Session established

2. **User navigates to swipe screen**:
   - `getRecipeStack` called with auth session
   - Checks for DindinUser profile
   - **Auto-creates profile if missing**
   - Returns unseen recipes

3. **User swipes on recipes**:
   - `likeRecipe` called
   - Profile exists or gets created
   - Preferences saved

## Default Profile Values

When auto-created, profiles get sensible defaults:
- **Cooking Skill**: beginner
- **Max Cook Time**: 60 minutes
- **Spice Level**: medium
- **Notifications**: Matches enabled
- **Empty Arrays**: No dietary restrictions, allergies, or seen recipes

## Testing Instructions

For existing users who got the error:
1. Simply refresh the app or tap "Refresh" button
2. Recipes will now load (profile auto-created)
3. All functionality works normally

For new users:
1. Sign up as normal
2. Navigate to swipe screen
3. Recipes appear immediately

## Verification
- ✅ Backend server restarted with changes
- ✅ Auto-creation logic in place
- ✅ Default values properly set
- ✅ Both getRecipeStack and likeRecipe handle missing profiles
- ✅ User router also has auto-creation

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always auto-create related records when possible
2. Use database triggers or middleware for profile creation
3. Consider single user model with embedded auth data
4. Add integration tests for new user flows

## Status
**RESOLVED** - Users can now see recipes immediately after signing up. The DindinUser profile is automatically created on first API call, ensuring smooth user experience.
